ZERO.js - Returns you nothing but zero

This project supports all versions of JavaScript and Node.js.
If it does not work, make sure you didn't do something stupid.
With ZERO.js, you can to "Zero" arithmetics.
Like so:

    var zero = require('@thevvx/zero'); // Import the module
    var a = zero(); // Create a new zero
    var b = zero(); // Create another zero
    var c = a + b;  // Add them together
    console.log(c); // Returns 0

That's it! You can do all sorts of things with zeros.
